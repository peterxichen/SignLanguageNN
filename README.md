# SignLanguageNN

Abstract

----------------------------------------------
Uses dataset containing 2062 sign language digits images(https://github.com/ardamavi/Sign-Language-Digits-Dataset) to classify only 0 and 1 using a logistic regression and 2 layer artificial neural network. 

Deployment

----------------------------------------------
- logistic_nn.py - runs logistic regression for binary classification set up as a one layer neural network, also implemented in scikit-learn for comparison
- 2layer_nn.py - runs two layer artifical neural network for binary classification, also implemented in keras for comparison
